## What is the Minnesota Animal Movement Archive?

The Minnesota Animal Movement Archive is a collection documenting animal movement and behaviors across the state of Minnesota. It aims to bring together datasets from Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund (ENRTF) projects and partnerships with State, Tribal, Federal, and University researchers to create a unified resource for understanding how Minnesota's wildlife navigate and use their habitats. The archive is hosted on [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org).

## Who can participate?

Researchers, wildlife managers, and conservation organizations working in Minnesota are invited to join. The archive welcomes data from any tracked species, including both completed studies and ongoing monitoring programs and research projects.

## How do I get started?

Visit our [Submission Guide](submission_guide.qmd) page for step-by-step instructions for submitting your data to the archive.


## What are the benefits of participating?

-   Access to Movebank's data management, analysis, and archiving tools
-   Your data becomes discoverable through the archive webpage and interactive map
-   Connection with researchers working on similar species and habitats across Minnesota
-   Access to MoveApps analysis tools for collaborative conservation efforts
-   Enhanced visibility for your work in funding proposals and presentations
-   Seamless data collection through live feeds from common tag manufacturers

## What does it cost?

It's free. All participation, data storage, and support are free to data owners.

## Does this mean Movebank or the archive owns my data?

Absolutely not. You maintain complete ownership and control over your data through Movebank's permission settings.

## Do I have to make my data public?

No! The archive supports both public and controlled-access options. You can participate with ongoing studies, sensitive species locations, or data requiring formal sharing agreements. We encourage making completed datasets public when appropriate, but you decide when and how to share your data.

## What privacy options are available on Movebank?

You can choose from several permission levels, some examples include:

**Public summary only**: Public can see study details but no location data

**Public tracks**: Public can view animal locations on maps but cannot download data

**Public data**: Full public access to downloadable data after accepting terms of use

**Future public data**: Set an embargo date (up to 10 years) for future public release

## How are data used and shared?

Data owners are never obligated to share data. For public data, users are encouraged to contact owners to discuss collaborations and must accept Movebank's terms of use. For non-public data, owners choose whether to participate in specific projects and can require formal data sharing agreements. All attribution and co-authorship is decided between data owners and users for each case.

## Can the archive project create visualizations of my data?

Yes, but with privacy protections and only if your data are publicly available. We may create public summaries, maps, and animations, but original source data (individual animal locations and times) are never exposed publicly. Visualizations limit viewable scale to 1:250,000 or show density within 10 kmÂ² bins, and all visualizations acknowledge the archive and data owners.

## Who runs the archive?

The archive is an initiative funded by the ENRTF and is managed by Dr. John Fieberg and PhD student Smith Freeman in the University of Minnesota's Conservation Sciences program. The archive is additionally supported by Movebank's Lead Data Curator, Sarah Davidson. Checkout [About Us](about.qmd).
